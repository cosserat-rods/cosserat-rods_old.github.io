title: Elastica + Control
---
Elastica can be used to develop novel control methodologies for soft structures using both traditional control methods as well as machine learning techniques. Currently, many control algorithms are based on rigid body dynamics. While these have had success, soft body structures introduce new dynamics that rigid body solvers are not able to account for. By developing control algorithms with Elastica, these soft body dynamics can be incorporated and exploited for more precise and robust control.  Elastica is being being used to enable control through multiple different projects. 

## CyberOctopus
This ONR MURI project seeks to develop a simulation environment where new control algorithms based on the neurodynamics and biology of octopuses can be used to enable control of the next generation of soft robotics. Elastica is being used to enable accurate simulation of the octopuses arms. Learn more at the [project website](https://cyberoctopus.csl.illinois.edu/index.asp). 

## NCSA-NVIDIA Hackathon
[NCSA-NVIDIA AI Hackathons](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/data/deep_learning/news/hal_spring20) are co-sponsored by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and NVIDIA. The goal of the hackathons are to let talented University of Illinois students, postdocs and staff showcase their skills while working on challenging problems involving deep learning on a state-of-the-art compute platform designed for AI. Elastica has been used to pose challenging problems for the Hackathon related to developing AI control algorithms for soft-body structures. 


## Elastica + Control API
Based on the work being done in the CyberOctopus project and the NCSA-NVIDIA Hackathons, we are working to develop an Elastica + Control API (similar to the OpenAI Gym API) to enable an easy interface for researchers working on control who wish to use Elastica.
