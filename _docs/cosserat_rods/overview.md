Many natural and artificial systems can be viewed as made up of soft, slender structures. These structures can be both active and passive. Examples from natural systems are DNA strands, flagella, muscle fibers, and snakes, illustrating the wide range of length scales these systems span. In artificial systems, examples of such structures are woven cloth, artificial muscles, long cables. 

When the length of such structures is much larger than the radius (L/r >> 1), the structure can be viewed as a 1-dimensional rod, allowing substantial simplification of its mathematical treatment. Cosserat rods are a mathemetical description of such 1-dimensional slender structures that incorporates the effects of bending, twisting, stretching and shearing. This allows Cosserat rods to describe the effects of all six degrees of freedom of the rod. These Cosserat rods can be modeled as single rods or can also be combined to model more complex systems such as a collection of muscle fibers. 

For more information on the theory behind Cosserat rods see: [**Single Rods**](../single-rods/).   
To see how they can be combined to create more complex system, see: [**Multiple Rods**](../multiple-rods/).  
For details on the numerical method we use to solve these systems see: [**Numerics**](../numerics).  
Finally, for some examples of how Cosserat rods have been used to model a number of different physical systems see: [**Case Studies**](../case-studies/).
