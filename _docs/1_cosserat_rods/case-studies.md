Cosserat rods have been used to model a wide range of different physical systems. These systems can either consist of a [single rod](#single-rod-systems) undergoing deformation or [multiple rods](#multiple-rod-systems) stitched together to create more complex systems. The case studies below illustrate how Cosserat rods can be used to analyze both naturally occurring and artificially created systems to provide insight into mechanics, dynamics and control.


# Single Rod Systems
#### Swimming and Slithering 
Cosserat rods can be used to analyze the effects of swimming and slithering...

#### Solenoids and Plectonomes
When a long, thin rod is twisted, it will eventually curl up on itself..

# Multiple Rod Systems
#### Skeletal Muscles
Skeletal muscles can be thought of as long, thin fibers. These can be modeled at a collection of Cosserat rods.
