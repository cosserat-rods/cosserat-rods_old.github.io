Cosserat rods have been used to model a wide range of different physical systems. These systems can either consist of a [single rod](#single-rod-systems) undergoing deformation or [mutltiple rods](#multiple-rod-systems) stitched together to create more complex systems. The case studies below illustrate how cosserat rods can be used to analyze both naturally occuring and artifically created systems to provide insight into mechanics, dynamics and control.


## Single Rod Systems
#### Swimming and Slittering 
Cosserat rods can be used to analyze the effects of swimming and slittering... 

#### Solenoids and Plectonomes
When a long, thin rod is twisted, it will eventually curl up on itself..

## Multiple Rod Systems
#### Skeletal Muscles
Skeletal muscles can be thought of as long, thin fibers. These can be modeled at a collection of cosserat rods.

#### Soft Robotics and Bio-robotics
New generations of robotics are seeking to develop both soft and biological robotics.
