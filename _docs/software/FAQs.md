>Is there support available for Elastica?

While we are actively developing Elastica, currently we have limited ability to provide support. If you ask a questions on GitHub, we will do our best to help you out. 

>How should I cite Elastica?

We ask that any publications which uses Elastica cite the following papers:
<p class="reference" style="font-size:12pt; ">
Zhang, Chan, Parthasarathy, Gazzola, <strong>Modeling and simulation of complex dynamic musculoskeletal architectures</strong>, Nature Communications, 2019. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12759-5">doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12759-5</a>
</p>

<p class="reference" style="font-size:12pt; ">
Gazzola, Dudte, McCormick, Mahadevan, <strong>Forward and inverse problems in the mechanics of soft filaments</strong>, Royal Society Open Science, 2018. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.171628">doi: 10.1098/rsos.171628</a>

>Do Pylastica and Elastica++ have the same features?

Almost. Due to development cycles, they may not always be equally up to date. If there is a feature in one that you would like to see in the other, let us know on GitHub.
