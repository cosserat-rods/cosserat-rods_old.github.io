Elastica is open source and we welcome anyone to help us develop and improve it. 

If you are interested in contributing to the code, connect with us on [GitHub](link_for_github). We are always looking for people to contribute code to both improve Elastica's current abilities or add new ones. 

If you have new ideas on how to use Elastica for research and want to collaborate with us, email [Mattia Gazzola](mailto:mgazzola@illinois.edu) or [Noel Naughton](mailto:nnaught2@illinois.edu).
